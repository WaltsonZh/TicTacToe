This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe web game implemented using vanilla JavaScript.
The game board is represented using HTML table cells, and the player symbols are drawn on canvas elements within each cell.

## How to Play

- Visit [my site](https://wzh-tictactoe.netlify.app/) to play.
- Choose your move of "X" or "O" ("X" always starts first, choose "O" to let AI go first).


## AI Algorithm

The AI opponent uses a simple algorithm to make its moves. It follows a set of rules to prioritize certain moves based on the current game state:

1. If it's the AI's first move, it will place its symbol in the center cell if it's available. Otherwise, it will place it in any corner cell.
2. If it's the AI's second move, it will block the player if the player has a winning move or place its symbol in an optimal position to create two in a row.
3. On subsequent moves, the AI will try to win the game if it has two in a row or block the player if the player has two in a row.
4. If there are no immediate winning moves or blocking moves, the AI will place its symbol in an empty cell based on a predetermined priority order.
